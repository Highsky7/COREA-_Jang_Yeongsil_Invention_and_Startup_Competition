- **Subtitle Broadcasting**: Transmits the generated subtitles from the professor's client to each student's client, displaying real-time subtitles on the students' device screens.
- **Student Question Submission**: Students can submit questions directly from their devices via the server's question tab. Professors receive and are notified of student questions in real-time on their devices.
